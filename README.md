## Overview

**PETOBIA** is a student-run pet adoption and welfare website developed as a collaborative student activity assignment. The project simulates the full informational surface of a real nonprofit animal shelter: from a branded landing page to adoption listings, services, and community registration.

The primary goals were to practice **multi-page site architecture**, semantic HTML5, responsive CSS layout, and the fundamentals of team-based frontend development — including consistent design language across independently developed pages.
